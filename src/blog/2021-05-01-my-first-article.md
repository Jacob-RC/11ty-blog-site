# Essential Information

Income is money received in exchange for goods and services. For individuals, this can be in the form of wages paid for their labor. For businesses, it can be money paid to them in exchange for services.

Properly managing one's income is the building block of sound financial planning. Understanding how to properly manage your income, not just by growing it, is an essential first step upon which the rest of your financial planning grows.

# Active vs Passive

Active income is income earned from performing some activity. Examples include salary paid in exchange for completing a job and commissions earned from a side hustle. You had to _actively_ complete a job to earn your salary.

Passive income is income earned **without** needing to perform some activity. Ex. dividends paid on stocks (A dividend is when companies directly pay out money to their shareholders every couple of months). No direct action was required to get the dividend income (other than holding the stock) so that income was _passively_ generated.

It's not necessary to differentiate between the two (active income is never strictly better than passive or vice versa), but having a general understanding of whether your income is active or passive can help you plan for changes. For example, if you're planning for retirement, be aware that your active income will drastically decrease if not completely disappear.

It's also helpful to acknowledge that most income is going to be active. Passive income is, by definition, getting paid to do nothing, and in most circumstances, people aren't going to pay you to do nothing.

**Note:** Monthly rent earned by renting out properties is generally considered passive income, but the process of earning it generally requires active involvement. It's important to recognize the active component of many sources of passive income (even if it's just management and upkeep of the income).

# Income Streams

Income streams are sources of a regular supply of money, such as investments or salaries. They can be active or passive. An active income stream may be your salary, which gets paid biweekly. A passive income stream might be profits from an investment.

Most people will probably have one main income stream, like a job. Businesses may have more diversified income streams. They may have profits from a product they sell, income from investments, and additional income from services they provide.

A general rule of thumb is to generate multiple diversified income streams. Having a variety of sources of income helps you remain resilient to sudden changes like getting fired. Examples may include having a portfolio of dividend-generating stocks, collecting rent from properties, or working a side hustle.

# Different Types of Income

[There are many different types of income that exist](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp). 

**Gross Income**: Total value of your salary or payments, not considering what you spend. (The face value you get paid)

**Net Income**: Your gross income minus relevant taxes and fees. (The amount that ends up in your hands)

**Discretionary Income**: Your net income minus paying necessary expenses. The money that you can _choose_ how to spend.

**Taxable Income**: The amount of income that you must pay relevant taxes on.

[**Capital Gains**](<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp#:~:text=Error%20Code%3A%20100013)-,What%20Is%20a%20Capital%20Gain%3F,own%20is%20a%20capital%20asset.>): Profit earned from selling assets (like stocks) that have appreciated in value. Within capital gains, there is a distinction for how long you've held the asset. If you've held the asset for under a year, the profit made from selling the stock is lumped into your taxable income. If you've held the asset for over a year, the profits are taxed at a lower tax rate.

**Tax-Exempt Income**: Interest paid on certain government bonds can be treated as tax-free.

**Ordinary Income**: Income earned from earnings, interest, rental properties, prize winnings, rental properties, etc. The overwhelming majority of income (any income not specifically considered capital gains or tax-exempt) is considered ordinary income.

# Taxation

This section is a high-level overview of income taxes. More detailed information regarding taxation can be found in the taxation section.

In general, you will always pay federal income tax, and depending on where you live, you may be obligated to pay state and municipal (city-level) income taxes as well.

Every year, all of your taxable earnings are combined into a big figure called your "Gross Income" (This is the same thing as taxable income). Your gross income is subtracted by adjustments from things like student loan interest payments and educator expenses. The resulting number is called your [Adjusted Gross Income or AGI](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income). Your AGI ultimately determines the tax bracket you fall into and your ultimate tax burden.

The US currently uses a progressive tax model, where as income increases, your tax rate on that additional income increases. In other words, as you earn more money, you pay a greater percentage of that money in taxes.

# Salary vs Wages

There are 2 common ways of compensating people for their labor. Salaries are fixed incomes paid to employees weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Wages are variable incomes paid out to employees at the end of a pay period (which is at least once per month) depending on the hours worked by that employee. In other words, wages depend on how many hours are worked, while salaried employees will always be paid a certain pre-determined amount regardless of hours worked.

While there is no clear-cut answer as to which one is better, but [here are a couple of the important factors to consider](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/031115/salary-vs-hourly-how-benefits-laws-differ.asp). Salaried positions are more common in managerial roles while hourly employment is more common in industries like retail, hospitality and services and often is for part-time or entry-level positions. Salaried employees may end up working longer hours without additional compensation like overtime pay. Hourly employees are more often most likely to feel the impact when their employer goes through tough times through a reduction in their hours. Finally, hourly employees may have fewer employer benefits like health insurance depending on hours worked.

# Total Compensation

[Total compensation](https://www.pelagohealth.com/resources/hr-glossary/total-compensation/) is the sum of all forms of payment and benefits an employee receives. This includes an employee's base pay along with benefits like medical/dental coverage, retirement benefits, and additional overtime compensation.

When considering compensation, it's useful to look at all included benefits (including those offered that you may not use) to make a well-informed decision.

# Career Development

Each company will have its own pay progression track. [Common factors used to determine salary](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/#:~:text=I%20found%20that%20the%20people,Same%20thing%20applies%20for%20titles.) are the length of employment, the pay rates of their competitors, company performance, individual performance, team performance, skill development, inflation-related or promotions. Most jobs have their own salary progression pre-determined.

Another factor worth considering is salary progression relative to inflation. Average inflation is somewhere usually around 2% per year. If an employee's salary growth is 1%, their salary isn't actually beating inflation. In the long run, their purchasing power will decrease. Comparing pay progression with inflation helps paint a better picture as to how your income may grow or shrink over time.

Another important piece of the puzzle is changing jobs. [Changing jobs can and does often have a big boost on salary.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/#:~:text=I%20found%20that%20the%20people,Same%20thing%20applies%20for%20titles.) There's a couple reasons why this is. Employee pay progression is generally standardized to a couple of percent per year. Changing jobs allows you to re-negotiate a base pay. Companies competing for talent may also be more willing to pay more when hiring to attract the best talent. Ultimately, moving between companies is a complex decision that involves more than just salary considerations. Still, it's useful to recognize how moving can increase long-term career earnings.
