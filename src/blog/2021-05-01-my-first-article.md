# Essential Information

Income is money recieved in exchange for goods and services. For individuals this can be in the form of wages paid for their labor. For businesses, this can be money paid to them in exchange for services.

Properly managing one's income is the building block of sound financial planning. Understanding how to properly manage your income, not just by growing it, is an essential first step upon which the rest of your financial planning grows.

# Active vs Passive

Active income is income earned from performing some activity. Ex, salary paid in exchange for completing a job, commissions earned from a side hustle. You had to _actively_ complete a job to earn your salary.

Passive income is income earned **without** needing to perform some activity. Ex. dividends paid on stocks (A dividend is when companies directly pay out money to their shareholders every couple of months). No direct action was required to get the dividend income (other than holding the stock), so that income was _passively_ generated.

It's not super necessary to differentiate between the two, (active income is never strictly better than passive or vice versa) but having a general understanding of if your income is active or passive can help you plan for changes. For example, if you're planning for retirement, be aware that your active income will drastically decrease if not completely disappear. 

It's probably also useful to acknowledge that most income is going to be active. Passive income is by definition, getting paid to do nothing, and in most circumstances, people aren't going to pay you to do nothing.

**Note:** Monthly rent earned by renting out properties is generally considered passive income, but the process of earning it generally requires active involvement. It's important to recognize the active component of a lot of sources of passive income. (Even if it's just management and upkeep of the income).

# Income Streams

Income streams are sources of a regular supply of money. This can be from sources like investments or salaries. Income streams can be active or passive. An active income stream may be your salary, which gets paid biweekly. A passive income stream might be profits from an investment made. 

Most people will probably have one main income stream like a job. Businesses may have more diversified income streams. They may have profits made on a product that they sell, income from investments and additional income from services they provide.

A general rule of thumb is to generate multiple diversified income streams. In general, diversification is an important concept in personal finance. Having a variety of sources
