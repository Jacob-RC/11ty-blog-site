# Essential Information

Budgeting is the practice of setting aside portions of your income towards various different categories of expenses. A budget is a plan to help people manage their money. It is an estimation of a person's income and expenses (how much they make and how much they spend) in a given period of time. 

Budgets are a useful tool to help you better visualize your finances and avoid unnecessary expenditures. It helps answer the question: _Can I really afford it?_ A proper budget will also allow you to set and work towards your financial goals like purchasing a house, avoid or reduce debt and track your income/expenses. 

# Getting Started Budgeting

Anyone and everyone should have a good sense of what their budget looks like. Start by looking at your post-tax income. This is the amount of money that you'll actually be able to spend on your expenses. (Note that federal income tax is not paid when you receive your salary, but rather yearly. You should set aside money from your paycheck to cover this later cost before you calculate your post-tax income).

The next step is to look at which budgeting system is right for you. A budgeting system is a way of monitoring your finances and setting aside money for specific purposes. Here are a couple of [popular budgeting systems](https://srfs.upenn.edu/financial-wellness/browse-topics/budgeting/popular-budgeting-strategies):

# 50/30/20 Budgeting

One of the most popular budgeting system, a 50-30-20 budget means setting aside 50% of your post-tax income towards needs. Needs are expenses that must be paid such as groceries, housing, utilities, insurance, minimum loan payments. 

30% of your post-tax income goes towards wants. A want is something that is nice to have, but not strictly necessary for you to live. Examples of common wants may include dinners out, gifts, travel, and entertainment. Making sure to set aside money towards wants and fun expenses allows you to enjoy your money and helps you stick with your budget in the long run.

20% of your post-tax income would go towards savings or paying down debts. This money can be used to save towards your financial goals like retirement or purchasing a house. It can also be used towards paying down debts. In general, debts will have a minimum payment which is included in needs. You must pay back the minimum monthly payment to avoid hefty fines. In addition, you have the option to be able to put more money towards the loan. Paying down debt reduces the amount of interest you will have to pay in the future.

Budgeting is also different for each person. Sometimes, setting aside 50% of income is not enough to cover expenses. You may need to dip into the "wants" portion of you budget for a while to cover these expenses. While it might be tempting to dip into the 20% savings category, try not to, as it's always better to sacrifice a bit of short-term spending than long-term stability.

# Budget Priorities

Prioritizing expenses can be a difficult and confusing task. [Here is a list of potential priorities to put your money towards.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget)

## 1. Emergency fund

Life happens. Having an emergency fund with enough money to cover bare-bones living expenses is one of the most important personal finance principles. This emergency fund will also provide a cushion to cover any suprise expenses like small emergencies and repairs.

## 2. Employer match on your 401(k)

We'll go more in depth during the retirement section but at a high level, a 401(k) is a retirement account. Many companies will have a benefit called a "401(k) match". This is an incentive to encourage you to save towards retirement. Your employer may match the money you set aside towards retirement up to a certain amount. That is, if you set aside $50 for your retirement, your employer will give you another $50 for free. In most circumstances, it's free money so it always makes sense to maximize this.

## 3. Eliminating Toxic Debt

Not all debt is created equal. Some debt like credit card loans, payday loans title loans all carry incredibly high interest rates. They can quickly balloon out of control causing you to end up repaying 2-3 times what you initially borrowed. Try to not take out these loans, and if you do have them, to pay them off as quickly as possible. 

## 4. Additional Retirement Savings

Even if your employer isn't giving you free money anymore, it's still a good idea to make it a habit to invest towards retirement. As Einstein aptly put, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it". The earlier you start setting aside money for your retirement, the longer it has to compound and grow.

## 5. Debt Repayment

It's often a good idea to use additional money to pay off additional debt. Even if the interest rates aren't exhorbidantly high, debt still will cost you money. Paying this down reduces how long you'll have to spend paying off the loan.
