# Essential Information

Budgeting is the practice of setting aside portions of your income towards various different categories of expenses. A budget is a plan to help people manage their money. It is an estimation of a person's income and expenses (how much they make and how much they spend) in a given period of time. 

Budgets are a useful tool to help you better visualize your finances and avoid unnecessary expenditures. It helps answer the question: _Can I really afford it?_ A proper budget will also allow you to set and work towards your financial goals like purchasing a house, avoid or reduce debt and track your income/expenses. 

# Getting Started Budgeting

Anyone and everyone should have a good sense of what their budget looks like. Start by looking at your post-tax income. This is the amount of money that you'll actually be able to spend on your expenses. (Note that federal income tax is not paid when you receive your salary, but rather yearly. You should set aside money from your paycheck to cover this later cost before you calculate your post-tax income).

The next step is to look at which budgeting system is right for you. A budgeting system is a way of monitoring your finances and setting aside money for specific purposes. Here are a couple of [popular budgeting systems](https://srfs.upenn.edu/financial-wellness/browse-topics/budgeting/popular-budgeting-strategies):

# 50/30/20 Budgeting

One of the most popular budgeting system, a 50-30-20 budget means setting aside 50% of your post-tax income towards needs. Needs are expenses that must be paid such as groceries, housing, utilities, insurance, minimum loan payments. 

30% of your post-tax income goes towards wants. A want is something that is nice to have, but not strictly necessary for you to live. Examples of common wants may include dinners out, gifts, travel, and entertainment. Making sure to set aside money towards wants and fun expenses allows you to enjoy your money and helps you stick with your budget in the long run.

20% of your post-tax income would go towards savings or paying down debts. This money can be used to save towards your financial goals like retirement or purchasing a house. It can also be used towards paying down debts. In general, debts will have a minimum payment which is included in needs. You must pay back the minimum monthly payment to avoid hefty fines. In addition, you have the option to be able to put more money towards the loan. Paying down debt reduces the amount of interest you will have to pay in the future.

Budgeting is also different for each person. Sometimes, setting aside 50% of income is not enough to cover expenses. You may need to dip into the "wants" portion of you budget for a while to cover these expenses. While it might be tempting to dip into the 20% savings category, try not to, as it's always better to sacrifice a bit of short-term spending than long-term stability.

To get started with 50-30-20 budgeting, compile your monthly post-tax income and divide it into money for your needs wants and savings. As you spend, categorize each expense and make sure they fit within your budget for that category. Adjust the actual percentages as necessary.

A 50-30-20 budget is quite easy to follow and implement. It provides a nice general structure to think about how different parts of your income can be used for distinct goals. By also accounting for wants in a budget, a 50-30-20 budget helps create a balanced budget that allows you to cover your needs, have fun, and also work towards your financial goals.

As previously mentioned, a 50-30-20 budget lacks customizeability. As incomes go towards either extreme, more or less than 50% of income may be required to cover expenses. When using a 50-30-20, understand that it's a rough guideline that should be modified based on your unique financial situation.

# Zero Based Budgeting

Zero-based budgeting, as the name implies, involves having zero dollars left over at the end of every month. Each dollar is assigned a specific expense. At the end of a month, each dollar of your income will have an explicit purpose that it is put to doing. Any long-term financial goals, like saving for a house or retirement are also expenses built into your monthly total. Note though, that things that normally wouldn't be considered expenses like saving for a home, or chairitable donations are considered expenses in zero-based budgeting. 

To start with zero-based budgeting, compile your monthly income as well as your monthly expenses. These expenses should include all saving you plan to do. Adjust the amount of money put into each expense such so that everything you need is covered while also spending spending all your money. As you go, make sure to adjust your expenses so that you have an accurate idea going forward of how much you need to budget away towards each expense.

Some advantages of a zero-based budget are that it helps give a clear picture of the money that flows in and out. It's also very flexible, allowing each person to customize it to help them meet their own unqiue financial goals. 

On the other hand, a zero-based budget doesn't do very well with variable expenses or expenses that you didn't plan for. A sudden car malfunction will most likely not be included as an expense in a zero based budget. It also requires a lot of time to properly plan and categorize each expense. 

# Pay Yourself First Budgeting

Similar to 50-30-20 budgeting, pay yourself first budgeting sets money aside for different goals. The key difference is that it starts with your financial goals. The whole concept of "paying yourself first" is that you first put money towards your financial goals and then use the rest to cover expenses. This helps make sure you're always on track to meet your savings goals.

To start with pay yourself first budgeting, identify your savings goals both short and long term. Common long-term goals include saving for retirement, building an emergency fund while common short-term goals include travel, new appliances or a house. Decide how much you need to contribute to each goal to accomplish them in a timely fashion. Use the remaining funds to cover your needs and wants. A good guideline is to start with a 50-30-20 approach of starting with around 20% of your income set aside towards savings. Ideally you want to be accounting for your financial goals, while also having enough money to cover your needs and wants.

One of the biggest advantages of pay yourself first budgeting is that it pushes you to focus on the big picture. When people save first, they have less money to spend on impulsive purchases and tend to buy things they need or of value.

While it's important to pay yourself first, you need to make sure that you have enough money left over to cover necessary living expenses. You can always increase your savings later. Another thing not accounted for with pay yourself first budgeting is the other financial goals that you may have, for example paying off credit card debt.

# Envelope Budgeting

Also known as cash stuffing, envelope budgeting involves setting aside portions of your income for specific expenses (like putting cash into an envelope where each envelope is designated for a specific purpose). When you spend in that category, you use money from that envelope. If it runs out of money, you have to wait until next month to spend in that category.

To get started, create a variety of categories, these could be as generic as needs wants and savings as based on a 50-30-20 budget, or as specific as "eating out". Once you've created these categories, set aside a portion of your income to each envelope. When it's time to spend, only use money from the corresponding envelope.

Some advantages of envelope budgeting is that it helps avoid overdraft fees and debt. Dividing up your money also helps make you aware how much you're spending on each category, which helps avoid overspending and impulse purchases.

If you decide to envelope budget with physical cash, it's an ever-present risk of loss or theft. Additionally, envelope budgeting requires proper knowledge of your expenses so that you set aside enough money to cover necessary expenses.

Regardless which budgeting strategy you choose, make sure to adjust them to your financial situation. There's no one-size-fits-all solution to personal finance.

After you pick a budget strategy, the hardest part comes next; sticking to it! Try to keep following your budgeting strategy, but don't be afraid to adjust it as necessary based on things that come up.

# 30 Day Rule

A simple but effective trick to reduce expenses on non-essential items. As a general rule of thumb, the next time you find yourself thinking about making an impulse purchase or buying any non-essential item, sit on that idea for 30 days. At the end of the 30 day period, if you still want to make the purchase, go for it. Alternatively, if you forgot about the purchase or decided that it wasn't worth it, you'll have saved some money.

Following the 30 day rule helps take the emotion out of spending by stopping us from spending money impulsively on things that don't actually make us happy or serve a utility.

# Ways To Help Balance Your Budget

A good general rule of thumb is to look to revise your budget every 2-3 months. Re-evaluate your expenses, goals and income streams. Being flexibile with your budget allows it to remain accurate and effective.

The easiest way to help balance your budget is to increase your income. While certainly easier said than done, working for more hours, doing freelance work or creating passive income streams can give you more money to work with.

Fixed expenses, which are expenses that cost the same or similar each month are often hard to lower. On the contrary, variable expenses, which are expenses that can change easily like eating out or shopping is much easier to decrease. Tracking your spending using budgeting apps can also help identify areas where you can cut back on variable expenses. 

Emergency funds, or a rainy-day fund, can also be useful in providing a buffer for budgets. Sudden expenses like a car breaking down or medical emergency can de-rail an otherwise sound budget. Having an emergency fund helps absorb these blows and helps prevent them from having large impacts on your budget.

# Budget Priorities

Prioritizing expenses can be a difficult and confusing task. [Here is a list of potential priorities to put your money towards.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget)

## 1. Emergency fund

Life happens. Having an emergency fund with enough money to cover bare-bones living expenses is one of the most important personal finance principles. This emergency fund will also provide a cushion to cover any suprise expenses like small emergencies and repairs.

## 2. Employer match on your 401(k)

We'll go more in depth during the retirement section but at a high level, a 401(k) is a retirement account. Many companies will have a benefit called a "401(k) match". This is an incentive to encourage you to save towards retirement. Your employer may match the money you set aside towards retirement up to a certain amount. That is, if you set aside $50 for your retirement, your employer will give you another $50 for free. In most circumstances, it's free money so it always makes sense to maximize this.

## 3. Eliminating Toxic Debt

Not all debt is created equal. Some debt like credit card loans, payday loans title loans all carry incredibly high interest rates. They can quickly balloon out of control causing you to end up repaying 2-3 times what you initially borrowed. Try to not take out these loans, and if you do have them, to pay them off as quickly as possible. 

## 4. Additional Retirement Savings

Even if your employer isn't giving you free money anymore, it's still a good idea to make it a habit to invest towards retirement. As Einstein aptly put, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it". The earlier you start setting aside money for your retirement, the longer it has to compound and grow.

## 5. Debt Repayment

It's often a good idea to use additional money to pay off additional debt. Even if the interest rates aren't exhorbidantly high, debt still will cost you money. Paying this down reduces how long you'll have to spend paying off the loan.
