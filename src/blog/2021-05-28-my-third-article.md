# Essential Information

Savings refers to the amount of money left over in a budget after necessary expenses are paid. Savings are essential to prepare you for your unexpected circumstances and allow you to work towards larger financial purchases. Savings also allow for you to get involved with investing, a key tool in building wealth.

Savings is intertwined with budgeting. Most budgets will include savings as part of the items included. The "pay yourself first" budgeting principle involves prioritizing savings and building the rest of the budget around it. Proper budgeting will allow you to build up your savings while covering your necessary monthly expenses.

# Saving vs Investing

Savings refers to cash in a low-risk environment like a bank account. These funds can be easily accessed. Investing typically refers to the practice of buying assets like stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or other investment vehicles. Investments will usually carry a higher risk, but have greater potential returns. On the contrary, due to their convenience, savings typically have lower rates of return.

Typically, savings are used in situations where you will need the value of the cash (like in an emergency fund) or have short-term goals that require quick access to cash (like when saving for a vacation). Investing is commonly used with excess savings to capture potentially signifianctly higher returns. It is typical to use a combination of both, to have the assurance of savings while also having the potential for gains with investing.

# Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is one of the most important part of savings and personal finance as a whole. Life us unpredictable and being prepared for the worst case scenario, even if you never end up using it, is one of the ways we can reduce the impact of unplanned circumstances. Another dynamic is that debt often snowballs. Borrowing to cover one unexpected expense can be a hole that's difficult to dig out of.

Experts recommend to have enough funds to cover 3-6 months of your necessary expenses . This includes every cost that you need to survive (enough to cover the _needs_ portion of your budget). It doesn't include _wants_ or optional expenses. Quite literally, the minimum amount of money required to survive.

When you're hit with a sudden financial expense such as being laid off or your car breaks down, you'll have a cushion to fall back on. This fund should not be touched for non-essential purchases like a fancy vacation. After you've drawn from the account, replenish it as soon as possible. 

Some other guidelines to help structure your emergency fund include using a separate savings account for your emergency funds. Additionally, the money should be accessible within a day and should not be invested in stocks or bonds. (The last thing you want in a financial emergency is to find out that you've overestimated your reserves). You may also want to consider shopping around for a savings account that will give you the most interest. 

If you're in a situation where saving 3-6 months of expenses is unfeasible or have outstanding high-interest loans like credit card debt, consider creating a modest emergency fund to start out with. [Nerdwallet ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget)recommends an emergency fund of at least $500, enough to cover small emergencies and repairs. From there, use any additional money to help pay down your existing debt.

Finally, after you've established an emergency fund, it's important to not over-save. Emergency funds are very liquid and even in best-case scenarios, have extremely low rates of interest. After you've reached your goal, it's a good idea to start investing your money where it has the best chance to grow.
