# Essential Information

Savings refers to the amount of money left over in a budget after necessary expenses are paid. Savings are essential to prepare you for your unexpected circumstances and allow you to work towards larger financial purchases. Savings also allow for you to get involved with investing, a key tool in building wealth.

Savings is intertwined with budgeting. Most budgets will include savings as part of the items included. The "pay yourself first" budgeting principle involves prioritizing savings and building the rest of the budget around it. Proper budgeting will allow you to build up your savings while covering your necessary monthly expenses.

# Saving vs Investing

Savings refers to cash in a low-risk environment like a bank account. These funds can be easily accessed. Investing typically refers to the practice of buying assets like stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or other investment vehicles. Investments will usually carry a higher risk, but have greater potential returns. On the contrary, due to their convenience, savings typically have lower rates of return.

Typically, savings are used in situations where you will need the value of the cash (like in an emergency fund) or have short-term goals that require quick access to cash (like when saving for a vacation). Investing is commonly used with excess savings to capture potentially signifianctly higher returns. It is typical to use a combination of both, to have the assurance of savings while also having the potential for gains with investing.
