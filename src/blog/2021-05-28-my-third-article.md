# Essential Information

Savings refers to the amount of money left over in a budget after necessary expenses are paid. Savings are essential to prepare you for your unexpected circumstances and allow you to work towards larger financial purchases. Savings also allow for you to get involved with investing, a key tool in building wealth.

Savings is intertwined with budgeting. Most budgets will include savings as part of the items included. The "pay yourself first" budgeting principle involves prioritizing savings and building the rest of the budget around it. Proper budgeting will allow you to build up your savings while covering your necessary monthly expenses.
