# Essential Information

Savings refers to the amount of money left over in a budget after necessary expenses are paid. Savings are essential to prepare you for your unexpected circumstances and allow you to work towards larger financial purchases. Savings also allow for you to get involved with investing, a key tool in building wealth.

Savings is intertwined with budgeting. Most budgets will include savings as part of the items included. The "pay yourself first" budgeting principle involves prioritizing savings and building the rest of the budget around it. Proper budgeting will allow you to build up your savings while covering your necessary monthly expenses.

# Saving vs Investing

Savings refers to cash in a low-risk environment like a bank account. These funds can be easily accessed. Investing typically refers to the practice of buying assets like stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) or other investment vehicles. Investments will usually carry a higher risk, but have greater potential returns. On the contrary, due to their convenience, savings typically have lower rates of return.

Typically, savings are used in situations where you will need the value of the cash (like in an emergency fund) or have short-term goals that require quick access to cash (like when saving for a vacation). Investing is commonly used with excess savings to capture potentially signifianctly higher returns. It is typical to use a combination of both, to have the assurance of savings while also having the potential for gains with investing.

# Emergency Fund

An emergency fund is one of the most important part of savings and personal finance as a whole. Life us unpredictable and being prepared for the worst case scenario, even if you never end up using it, is one of the ways we can reduce the impact of unplanned circumstances. Another dynamic is that debt often snowballs. Borrowing to cover one unexpected expense can be a hole that's difficult to dig out of.

Experts recommend to have enough funds to cover 3-6 months of your necessary expenses . This includes every cost that you need to survive (enough to cover the _needs_ portion of your budget). It doesn't include _wants_ or optional expenses. Quite literally, the minimum amount of money required to survive.

When you're hit with a sudden financial expense such as being laid off or your car breaks down, you'll have a cushion to fall back on. This fund should not be touched for non-essential purchases like a fancy vacation. After you've drawn from the account, replenish it as soon as possible. 

Some other guidelines to help structure your emergency fund include using a separate savings account for your emergency funds. Additionally, the money should be accessible within a day and should not be invested in stocks or bonds. (The last thing you want in a financial emergency is to find out that you've overestimated your reserves). You may also want to consider shopping around for a savings account that will give you the most interest. 

If you're in a situation where saving 3-6 months of expenses is unfeasible or have outstanding high-interest loans like credit card debt, consider creating a modest emergency fund to start out with. [Nerdwallet ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget)recommends an emergency fund of at least $500, enough to cover small emergencies and repairs. From there, use any additional money to help pay down your existing debt.

Finally, after you've established an emergency fund, it's important to not over-save. Emergency funds are very liquid and even in best-case scenarios, have extremely low rates of interest. After you've reached your goal, it's a good idea to start investing your money where it has the best chance to grow.

# [Savings vs Checkings](https://www.huntington.com/learn/saving/differences-between-checking-and-savings)

In most banks, you'll be presented with two options, to either create a savings or checkings account. A checkings account is generally used for everyday spending. It's typically used through a debit card, automatic bill payments or ATM withdraws. In exchange for the convenience of use, they typically earn less interest, or in many cases, none. 

A savings accounts are better used for storing money. In a savings account, your money may earn interest (although most likely lower than if you invested it). If you withdraw money too often, you may also be subject to penalties. A good idea is to keep your emergency fund in your checking account. Some banks even offer the ability to create both a savings and checking account, in which it's extremley convenient to move money between accounts. The combination of both also encourages people to save as it's easy to set up automatic saving.

In summary, a checkings account is a good idea for money that you plan to spend on monthly expenses. A savings account is good for funds that need to be quickly accessible but don't immediately need to use.

# Types of Savings Accounts

Within savings accounts, there's many different types, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. [Choose the right one for your financial goals.](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/types-of-savings-accounts/)

## Traditional or Regular Savings Account

These are your typical savings accounts. Most savings accounts made at banks fall into this category. These savings accounts typically have lower interest rates compared to other types of savings accounts in exchange for convenient access. Many online savings accounts also make it easy to cash checks or deposit spare cash into your account.

## High-Yield Savings Account

High-yield savings accounts are savings accounts that offer more interest compared to regular savings accounts. The main disadvantage is that not every bank offers them. Typically, only online banks and online credit unions offer them. As such, savers who use high-yield savings accounts will have to spend time moving money around. The process of transferring money between banks can take a few days to process. Additionally, due to their online nature, it may be harder to deposit and withdraw from your account.

## Money Market Accounts (MMAs)

Money market accounts try to combine the convenienece of checking accounts with the growth potential of savings accounts. They are a special type of banking account that allows you to get interest rates similar to high-yield savings accounts while also being able to write checks and access your account through a debit card.

In exchange for that convenience, they may contain certain types of fees. Banks may charge monthly fees for using a money market account or they may charge fees for withdrawing from your account too many times in one month.

## Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Certificates of deposit are time deposits, which means you agree to deposit your money for a certain period of time. They can be thought of as mini loans, in which you lend your money to the bank for an agreed upon period of time and in exchange are given interest on your money. After the agreed upon period of time has ellapsed, you'll earn an interest on your capital. In general, CDs offer some of the best interest rates of savings accounts, often similar to interest rates offered on bonds. 

Be warned though, CDs should only be used for money you're sure that you won't need. Accessing money set aside in a CD before the time has elapsed is subject to early [withdraw penalties.](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/cds/cd-early-withdrawal-penalty/)

CDs are a great choice if you won't need to access your savings right away and want to earn above-average interest rates. 

## Cash Management Account

Cash management accounts are a different type of savings account offered not by banks, but usually by brokerages (A brokerage is a platform you use to trade stocks, bonds and other commodities). They're useful for any cash that you might want to invest with but also may need to use to pay bills.

Due to how they're offered by brokerages instead of banks, depositing and withdrawing cash may be harder. They may also have minimum balance requirements and lower interest rates than high-yield savings accounts.

## Specialty Savings Accounts

Some savings accounts may have specific purposes and advantages. For example, [kids savings accounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/guide-to-childrens-and-kids-savings-accounts/) are special types of savings accounts designed to help kids get started managing their own finances. Additionally, there are savings accounts especially designed for families looking to save for their students college tuitions called [529 college savings accounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/how-to-fit-529-plans-into-your-college-savings-strategy/). Even for retirement, there are many different types of [individual retirement accounts (IRAs)](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/retirement-toolkit/self-directed-plans-individual-retirement-accounts-iras) that offer different types of benefits. 

Researching if there's a specialty type of savings account for your specific financial goal can make reaching that goal a lot easier. At the same time, they're a lot less flexible with what you can use that money on. Most specialty savings accounts contain restrictions on what or under what circumstances the money inside can be spent.
